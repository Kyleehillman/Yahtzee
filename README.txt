To use this interface, the user will enter the number of players they have 
and then will be sent to the game. There, there will be a roll button which                    
the player will select. The dice will appear at random and allow the user 
to pick which dice they want to keep. Selected die will turn yellow, unselected                
will stay white. Once the player has selected the ones they want, there is a                   
roll button they will press. This will allow them to roll the dice they didnt                  
choose to keep. After this is done, the player has to keep all the dice and                    
then need to pick a score. To pick a score, the player will select which score                 
they want to keep and then it will calculate the score. The scorecard holds the                
value they kept and then it will be the next player's turn. The next player will               
be able to start with random dice and this process will go again. The only difference          
between standard implementation and our game is that our game has 2 rolls and standard       
has 3.

We all contributed to all parts of this assignment. Kylee did the initial design               
and ideas of the program and then Andrew and Dori redesigned it. Andrew typed         
the new design to finalize it while everyone chimed in. Afterwards we all helped               
edit and plan the ideas for the graphics. Dori started the write up and everyone               
added to it. We all equally helped with the powerpoint and the README.txt.
